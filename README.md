## üåü Private IP Address Ranges
  - Private IP addresses are defined by the Internet standards and fall into specific ranges within
the IPv4 address space. These ranges are reserved for private use and are not allocated or
routable on the public Internet. The reserved ranges are:

1. Class A Private Range:
  -  Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  -  Number of Addresses: Approximately 16.7 million addresses

  -  Number of Addresses: Approximately 1 million addresses
3. Class C Private Range:
  -  Range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
  -  Number of Addresses: Approximately 65,000 addresses
1. Bus Topology
  - Description: All devices are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus or
backbone. Data travels in both directions along the bus.
  - Advantages:
    - Easy to set up and extend.
    - Requires less cable than other topologies.
  - Disadvantages:
    -  If the main cable fails, the entire network goes down.
    -  Performance degrades as more devices are added.
2. Star Topology
  -  Description: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. Data passes through
the hub before reaching its destination.
  - Advantages:
    -  If one connection fails, it does not affect the rest of the network.
    -  Easy to add or remove devices.
 - Disadvantages:
    -  If the central hub fails, the entire network goes down.
    -  Requires more cable than bus topology.
3. Ring Topology
  -  Description: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a circular pathway
for data. Data travels in one direction (or both, in a dual-ring setup).
  - Advantages:
    -  Data packets travel at high speeds.
    -  Easy to identify faults and isolate them.
  - Disadvantages:
    -  If one device fails, it can disrupt the entire network.
    -  Adding or removing devices can be disruptive.
4. Mesh Topology
  -  Description: Every device is connected to every other device, either fully or partially (in
a partial mesh).
  - Advantages:
    -  Highly reliable; if one connection fails, others can take over.
    -  Offers redundancy and multiple pathways for data.
  - Disadvantages:
    -  Expensive to implement due to the high amount of cabling and complexity.
    -  Difficult to set up and manage..
5. Hybrid Topology
  -  Description: A combination of two or more different topologies, such as star-bus or
star-ring.
  - Advantages:
    -  Flexible and scalable.
    -  Can be designed to suit specific network requirements.
  - Disadvantages:
    - Complex to design and implement.
    - Can be expensive depending on the mix of topologies used.

## üåü 1. Local Area Network (LAN)
  - Description: A network that connects computers and devices within a limited
geographic area, such as a home, school, or office building.
  - Characteristics:
    -  High speed, low latency.
    -  Usually owned and managed by a single organization.
  - Example: Office networks, home Wi-Fi networks.
2. Wide Area Network (WAN)
  -  Description: A network that covers a broad area, often connecting multiple LANs.
WANs can span cities, countries, or continents.
  - Characteristics:
    -  Lower speeds compared to LANs, higher latency.
    -  Often owned by multiple organizations or telecommunications providers.
  -  Example: The internet, corporate networks connecting multiple locations.
3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
  - Description: A network that covers a larger geographic area than a LAN but is smaller
than a WAN, typically within a city.
  - Characteristics:
    -  Can connect multiple LANs within a metropolitan area.
    -  Often used by businesses and government entities.
  - Example: City-wide Wi-Fi networks, cable TV networks.


## üåü How to check Number of Mac Address:
  -  Mac: networksetup -listallhardwareports
  -  Windows: getmac /v /fo list
### üëâ Range of Port Numbers
  -  Port numbers are represented as 16-bit unsigned integers, which
means they can range from 0 to 65535.
  - They are typically divided into three ranges:
    - Well-Known Ports (0-1023): These are reserved for
specific services and protocols, such as:
      - Port 80: HTTP
      - Port 443: HTTPS
      - Port 22: SSH (Secure Shell)
      - Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
    -  Registered Ports (1024-49151): These are assigned by
the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for specific
services that are not considered standard. Applications can
use these ports for their services.
    -  Dynamic or Private Ports (49152-65535): These are
typically used for client-side applications or dynamically
assigned ports by the operating system

### üëâ Comparison Table: TCP vs. UDP
| Feature               |                        TCP                            |                 UDP             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Connection            | Connection-oriented (three-way handshake)             | Connectionless (no handshake) |
| Reliability            | Reliable (guaranteeddelivery, retransmission)      | Unreliable (no guarantees on delivery) |
| Ordering               | Ensures packet order                              |  No ordering of packets |
| Error Checking     | Error checking with retransmission                   | Basic error checking (but no correction) |
| Flow & Congestion Control | Yes (adjusts based on network conditions) | No flow or congestion control |
| Speed | Slower due to overhead (error checking, etc.) | Faster due to less  overhead |
| Common Use Cases | Web browsing, email, file transfer | Streaming, gaming, DNS, VoIP |
| Data Segmentation | Breaks data into segments | Sends data as independent datagrams |
| Data Size  | Supports larger data packets | Typically used for small, quick data packets |

## üåü What is the OSI Model?
  - The OSI model consists of 7 layers of networking.
  
    `How to remember all the names of the layers? Easy: `

     1. Please | Physical Layer
     2. Do | Data Link Layer
     3. Not | Network Layer
     4. Tell (the) | Transport Layer
     5. Secret | Session Layer
     6. Password (to) | Presentation Layer
     7. Anyone | Application Layer

  `Let‚Äôs look at it with an Example: Luffy sends an e-mail to his friend Zoro.`

    - Step 1: Luffy interacts with e-mail application like Gmail , outlook , etc. Writes his email to send. (This happens in Layer 7: Application layer )

    - Step 2: Mail application prepares for data transmission like encrypting data and formatting it for transmission. (This happens in Layer 6: Presentation Layer )

    - Step 3: There is a connection established between the sender and receiver on the internet. (This happens in Layer 5: Session Layer )

    - Step 4: Email data is broken into smaller segments. It adds sequence number and error-checking information to maintain the reliability of the information. (This happens in Layer 4: Transport Layer )

    - Step 5: Addressing of packets is done in order to find the best route for transfer. (This happens in Layer 3: Network Layer )

    - Step 6: Data packets are encapsulated into frames, then MAC address is added for local devices and then it checks for error using error detection. (This happens in Layer 2: Data Link Layer )

    - Step 7: Lastly Frames are transmitted in the form of electrical/ optical signals over a physical network medium like ethernet cable or WiFi.

  - **After the email reaches the receiver i.e. Zoro, the process will reverse and decrypt the e-mail content. At last, the email will be shown on Zoro‚Äôs email client.**
